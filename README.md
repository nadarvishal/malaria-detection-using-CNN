Conventional diagnostic tool for malaria is the examination of stained blood cell of
patient in microscope. The blood to be tested is placed in a slide and is observed under a
microscope to count the number of infected RBC. Based on the guidelines from the
WHO protocol, this procedure involves intensive examination of the blood smear at a
100X magnification, where people manually count red blood cells that contain parasites
out of 5000 cells. An expert technician is involved in the examination of the slide with
intense visual and mental concentration. This is tiresome and time- consuming process.
